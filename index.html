   <header><p>The point of this tool is to make it easier to schedule your calendar and todolists and keep your life more organized.
       I also plan on incorporating ideas of organization and todos based off several books written by the author Cal Newport and his
       philosophy on achieving much while also staying focused on the task at hand.
   </p></header>
   <p>Currently the tool is only focused on being a web based platform, but my dream is to expand and build it for local, and mobile usage</p>
